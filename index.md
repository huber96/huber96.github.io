# Denis Huber - junior developer

## About me / O meni

Hi! My name is Denis Huber and I'm a recent graduate from the University of Organization and Informatics in Varaždin, Croatia. Below are some of the projects I've worked on in my free time. I've mostly been working with Unity and C# but I'm hoping to branch out soon!

Bok! Moje ime je Denis Huber i nedavno sam diplomirao sa Fakulteta Organizacije i Informatike u Varaždinu. U nastavku su navedeni neki projekti na kojima sam radio u svoje slobodno vrijeme. Uglavnom sam radio sa Unity i C# jezikom ali se nadam proširiti opseg rada.
